# EllipticCurveZp

/** 
	 * This class is used to create an elliptic curve object, of the type 
	 * y^2=x^3x+A*x+B mod p, where p is a prime, and then generate all the points on it and store them in the arraylist
	 * list_of_points. 
	 * It also finds the point on the Elliptic curve with the highest order.
